# The vegan detectr

## Description

 The application (app) will be designed to be intuitive and simple. When opening the app, it will open the camera within the app which will allow the user to scan text immediately. After the camera recognises and scans ingredients, then it will convert the ingredients onto another interface which will highlight in GREEN, RED, or AMBER the ingredients that it has scanned: 

- The **GREEN** means that the ingredients are vegan friendly. An example would be potatoes, which is not derived from animals. 

- **RED** indicates it is not vegan. The user can then click on the any RED (non-vegan) ingredients, which will then provide more information as to why the ingredient is not vegan; where the ingredients were derived from. An example of this would be red dye #40, which is red food colouring that’s been derived from beetles. 

- Lastly, some ingredients can return **AMBER** which is products that can be vegan, depending on that person’s perspective. One example of this may be a person that still chooses to consume oysters, as oysters do not have any pain receptors and are not a sentient being. Another example would be palm oil, which does not contain animal product, however, usually contributes to de-forestation and misplaces orang-utans. In these instances, with an AMBER highlight, there’ll be further information on why it is not clear, allowing the user to make their own informed decision. 
  

Users can also click on the ‘photo album’, which will be accessed as a square on the bottom left of the camera screen to use a picture from their photo album, which can include a picture previously taken from a menu or product, or text of a screenshot of ingredients from their phone. 

Other than the main feature to scan ingredients, the app will have an additional user input option. This is to copy and paste text into an ingredient checker, which will provide the same output as the application scanner. This provides users the option to either check an ingredient list, or to check a single ingredient.
