# The vegan detectr

## Skills Required 

* ### Programmers 

Programmers are vital in the production of a mobile app. From building the frontend; everything the user sees and interacts with, to the backend; the databases and architecture that make the app operational. Additionally, programmers are tasked with maintaining the software and ensuring it is compatible with Android and iOS devices. It is also important that they apply the best practices in all aspects for the sake of code quality and reusability, and ensure the front-end is communicating with the back-end appropriately. (Campana 2020) 

In the case of our Vegan Scanning App, every idea we’ve had must be implemented and managed by a programmer. They will need to take the appropriate approach in order to make a cross compatible application that implements all the features and functionality the group has brought forward. This process will be heavily influenced by any user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) decisions as the software must be designed to accommodate these. For example, if the interface is expected to make use of drop-down menus for navigation, the front-end development must reflect this. Our programmers will have to be extremely adaptive and proficient as they build, test, and deploy the app. Programming is a large part of the process and a vast array of skills and tools will be required such as backend/frontend development experience, third party text-scanning APIs, and cloud storage to name a few.  

* ### Network Analyst 

As Cyber Security has been rising in jobs, fundings & malicious hackers, it has created a new world of security. Involving many roles & positions to appear in the scene, Network Analysts are seen as the soul bearer of the architectural structure & design of the blueprints created. They have been created to ensure the policies & strategies for designing, planning & coordinating an orgnisations network with methods such as; 

* Total system environment and architecture 
* Monitoring system performance 
* Software and hardware 
* Backups 
* Support & netwotk maintenance 
    (Australian Government Joboutlook, ND). 

The need of a Network Analyst worker is compulsory and their knowledge is precise. Monitoring system performance is a key component that our application requires & network analysts can have an understanding with Machine Learning developments & AI integration to allow the users dictate the experience and self-development of real-life interactions. 

* ### Database Specialist 

A database specialist is important for any situation in which a database is to be utilised. Their role is to ensure that large amounts of data is managed efficiently, securely backed up, and is understandable and accessible to whomever must use it. They are responsible for building, managing and fixing the databases, including the design process. (Database Specialist: Career and Salary Facts n.d.) 

Within the Vegan Scanning App, the programmers and database specialists will have to work closely with each other as the data is directly accessed within the application. In this specific case, the data must be carefully validated according to the criteria of what makes vegan ingredients vegan. When the community feature for collaborative ingredient classification is introduced, a flag feature will accompany it to avoid any trolls ruining the app’s integrity. Once an ingredient has been flagged enough times, a database manager may be tasked with making a judgement on whether or not the ingredient was adhering to vegan guidelines. 

* ### UI/UX Designer 

The breakdown of what UI & UX are is key to understanding the designing process. User Interface (UI) is represented as an object or device that is user interactive with methods of sight & touch. Ipads, Touchscreens, Mobile Devices, Application interactions, writing your story on facebook, these are components that identify what UI is. User Experience (UX) is represented as the process of delivery, what methods must be taken first to understand what information users are seeking rather than sending mixed information. 

As we build the Vegan Application, both UI & UX must be user friendly to less complicate the scanning process. As we navigate towards the beginning of AI scanning, QR Barcode will be most ideal to produce simplistic implementation, this will encourage a pathway towards Machine Learning AI integration to scan and read ingredients on packages. 

* _'Non-Technical'_ skills would be required to ensure success of the program. Firstly a Business Analyst type role would be required, to ensure the user experience from the User Interface and User Experience role can be translated to what is required to be written by the Programmers. The Business Analyst would wear multiple 'hat's such as Project Management, Iteration Management, and more traditional BA role to document and coordinate the project team to work efficiently together. The BA would also then complete or organise testing for each MVP delivered on the project.  

* Additionally, marketing and market segmentation would be crucial to the success of this application. It would be most effective to have a resource with a marketing background would be critical. This is to ensure the target audience can be targeted to understand how this product is different to other current market offerings of vegan barcode scanners. The Marketer would complete analysis to understand how to reach the target audience, and how to effectively spend budget on advertising and other potential marketing opportunities such as posting into vegan groups that exist in Facebook and Reddit. A marketer would also be crucial in ensuring the ongoing success by completing analysis on what marketing was effective, and gaining feedback on what the users/consumers want to see in the application.  

It would be very feasible to set up a project team to set up this project, to ensure more success more research would be required and testing post prototype build.
