## What kind of work is done by the IT professional?  

Alex is an Security Solutions Architect at Suncorp, working within the Cyber Security Division. Alex's work mainly consists of leading projects from a technical point-of-view. He works with the vendors to ensure that they understand Suncorp's guiding principles, Architecture Strategy, and which products that they need to integrate with.  

Andrew essentially leads projects from an architecture point-of-view. He also assists project managers and the IT engineers to understand what they need to implement, typically putting together a high level design in applications such as Visio, so project teams can use to produce a detailed design. 

## What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?  

Alex works mainly with IT specialists across the whole Technology Function at Suncorp, which varies dependent on the project being worked on. The roles are mainly project personnel such as Project Managers, Business Analysts, Software Engineers. In addition to the project work, Alex also interacts frequently with Portfolio Management Office (PMO), Management, and Procurement teams, particularly when starting to kick of RFIs, RFQs, RFPs.  

## Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?  

As a Solutions Architect at Suncorp, Alex spends the predominant amount of time on Projects, as it's centric to provide oversight and direction around the projects, particularly in Cyber Security, providing advice and protocols. This is mainly done in the form of being part of working groups and also pulling together high level architecture concepts.  

## What aspect of their position is most challenging? 

The most challenging part is Project Timelines. As generally stakeholders want fairly aggressive timelines, however the 'red-tape' isn't usually factored in, so with all the Governance and Approvals required projects are usually not on schedule and results in rushed work, which usually results in re-work which is a waste of resources which could've been used more effectively with better planning.
