# Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity can be familiarised as a shield that is there to protect us from incoming projectiles. As the evolution & history of mankind has continued, it has provided us with strong knowledge of kingdoms protecting their land against the enemy with their defence systems, this is very similar to how Cybersecurity has been constructed into our worlds today. The age of chivalry was highly noticed by the community & is a medieval knightly system that followed a strict social code fitting of the kingdom they reside with. 
 
Cybersecurity specialists are the new age of chivalry as their main objective is to protect their kingdom from any incoming attacks or more-over revise a defence plan to negate any future incoming risks. The life of a cybersecurity specialist is very broad & complex, being a step-ahead of their nemesis is their primal objective. They must have a strong analytical mindset, must communicate thoroughly and clearly & must maintain a high level of integrity. Participating in the Cybersecurity industry will continuously provide constant variations of cybersecurity challenges & growth; therefore, cybersecurity can break into different sectors such as Cyber Security Analyst, Ethical Hacker or Penetration Tester, Cybersecurity Consultant, Security Software Developer, Computer Forensics Analyst, etc.
 
The history of cybersecurity is the beginning of it all. The human brain is a powerful tool that we had used throughout the years of technology, that has had initiation of being introduced to our daily lives. As computers were dramatically gigantic when first crafted, the power of malware & malicious attacks was tricky to find as access to a computer was not accessible as it is today. 
 
Katie (2020) stated 'the theory underlying computer viruses was first made public in 1949 when computer pioneer John von Neumann speculated that computer programs can reproduce'.
 
Over the years of security being established as a necessity to our future, we had thought of effective methods to acknowledge the mind of a hacker & what methods taken to penetrate defence systems. Ethical hacking operation was the first form of Penetration testing, this had enhanced the parameters in the development of defensive consideration & forming a defensive mindset that has been practiced since the 1960's (Chadd, 2020).
 
The first form of antivirus software was introduced in 1972, which was demonstrated with two programs. Globally renowned board game Cluedo provides a deeper insight of how investigations can provide you whom the target is & how to capture them. The concept applies & is manipulated into our computers; an unknown source appears, a trail of evidence to an unknown source, the unknown source remains hidden till the cyber security analyst investigates the matter & locates the unknown source and removes it from existence. This has sparked a revolution change in society as cybersecurity was maturing.  
 
Linden (1976) had provided insight on a statement made in 1976, "Security has become an important and challenging goal in the design of computer systems". This was mentioned by the Operating System Structures to Support Security and Reliable Software. 
 
Antivirus software was first commercialised in 1987, which defines it as the birth of Cybersecurity. Though, the birth of antivirus software going out to the public had created a vicious cycle of new attacks which required stronger technology to avoid infiltration. In the 1990's, our technologies advanced & we had the ability to invent the world's first polymorphic virus, this is a code designed to mutate, while keeping its origin to avoid detection of its whereabouts. 

Hackers, Viruses & Malware had increased, and many more innovative ideas were being produced. Hackers collectively were entering a new age as the computer technology was advancing and many new introductions such as Email, Websites, Credit Cards, Databases, multi-vector attacks & social engineering. Many high-profile organisations had an increasing demand of security specialists to create firewalls & systems to detect and filter any incoming malware. 
 
As we dive deeper into 21st century, we are living through the age of Technology and its enhanced advancements, therefore the consistent use of computers and the internet has overflowed with users signing up & will continue to grow in numbers as we drift into the future. 
 
Today in the world of the internet, there are different checkpoints and tasks for different levels of operation. 
 
On a personal level there is a checklist to minimize the amount of cyberattacks you get on your personal or work device. These involve; Ensuring the software you work with is up to date with their patches, Antivirus software is up to date, using strong password (complexity), Change default usernames & passwords, implement multi-factor authentication (MFA), install a firewall & be cautious of all your emails or unexpected emails (CISA, 2019).
 
On a corporate level there are some tools and tests available online to enable protecting towards your small-medium business. These involve, Vulnerability Scanners, Penetration testing, Program update checks, etc. These are the bare minimum-security layers that antivirus software provides with their packages, therefore technology has advanced to a degree to providing the essential needs for a business to operate but there is an expectation for the business owner to apply extra safety measures to ensure private information is secure and cannot be tampered.
 
In the upcoming years, there will be a dramatic demand in cybersecurity specialists to fill the market required. There are many businesses that are currently undergoing many changes towards how their business structure around security is & if there must be implementation of new & upcoming technologies to help solidify the network from any malicious hackers. These technologies are expressed by Katie Chadd, blog artist and author of 'The History of Cybersecurity' in 2020, the next gen of cybersecurity have been supplied enhancements and steroids boosting their multi-variety of approaches to increase malware detection of new & unmatched threats. Furthermore, the technologies described for the next gen are (Chadd, 2020):
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Network Behavioural Analysis (NBA) - identify malicious files based on behavioural deviations or anomalies.
- Threat intelligence and update automation.
- Real-time protection - also referred to as on-access scanning, background guard, resident shield and auto-protect.
- Sandboxing - creating an isolated test environment where you can execute a suspicious file or URL.
- Forensics - replaying attacks to help security teams better mitigate future breaches.
- Back-up and mirroring; and 
- Web application firewalls (WAF) - protecting against cross-site forgery, cross-site-scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and SQL injection.
 



The next-gen endpoint security is full of great technological opportunities to the community, engaging with a selection of options mentioned by Avast Business Team (2019):
1. Exploit mitigation.
2. Behavioural analysis.
3. Machine learning.
4. Deep learning.
5. Traffic detection.
6. Centralized event collection and analysis.
7. Ransomware behaviour detection and blocking.
8. Sandbox analysis, Rollback.  
9. Rollback of changes after event detection: and 
10. Retrospective detection.
 
The potential impact is Personal data due to the malicious intent that acts as a robbery by capturing assets of the riches. There is history of hackers obtaining credit cards, bank account details, computerized assets & data of confidential information.
 
My personal opinion is that the community is adapting and increasing in numbers but there is a small percentage of people that require aid when they interact with certain devices. Machine Learning & Social Engineering environments will follow a pathway of manipulation and turmoil; therefore, the demand of security awareness is an educational piece that we must adhere to.
 
Antivirus systems will have to adapt to the future environment. As the technology evolves into what we believe that is required to dismiss all future engagements with hackers & future malware. The innovation will only expand in size as the technology evolves and is feasible, the endless cycle of ‘Tom & Jerry’.
 
The Cyber Security industry is only increasing in value & demand. There are multiple opportunities to find a position within the market as there is a large amount money invested. Steve Morgan (2019) from Cybersecurity Ventures 'predicts global spending on cybersecurity products and services will exceed $1 trillion cumulatively over the five-year period from 2017 to 2021'.
 
There is a large demand of people to learn Cyber Security, Victorian has made Cyber Security apart of its free-course selections. (Victorian Skills Gateway, ND) 
 
The ongoing change in technology is moving at an extreme rate and being adaptable will be top priority if my objective is to achieve my Bachelors of IT. Personally, I believe having knowledge of Social Engineering will be a great attribute and skill to secure for my future endeavours.
 
My current occupation involves dealing with a pool of users that are monitor their interactions with the devices provided by the business. Cybersecurity is a technology that I deal with on a daily basis, the top three disturbances users engage with are social engineering influenced emails, windows notifications & machine learning search engines. Therefore, the defensive mentality is stapled in my daily routines and the knowledge I have acquired is forever evolving & adapting to new changes & lifestyles. 
 
Coming from an ethnic family, my parents are not great with technology therefore the guidance & precautions are advised by my siblings and myself. We have had to introduce technology to my parents at a slow rate, it was a journey itself and did have great engagements creating stories. 
 
My friends personally are quite computer savvy, it is a good benefit to acknowledge their occurrences to expand my awareness and knowledge of its properties and components.
