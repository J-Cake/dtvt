# 1.0 What does it do?
Raspberry Pis are small, inexpensive computers that are capable of performing tasks as any regular computer would. Coming in a number of different models, each with hardware upgrades from the last, the Raspberry Pi can be scaled to suit projects of a wide range of complexities. The educational appeal of these devices is they’re designed to teach the basics of computer hardware, software, and programming for a low price. Anyone can write a simple Scratch or Python script and see the computer begin interacting with the world through external modules such as cameras, sensors, and touch screen displays. Some projects that the Raspberry Pi Foundation website has suggested include building a remote-controlled/line-following robot, creating a doorbell chime via Sonic Pi, making a Python web server via Flask, and many more.
 
Most Raspberry Pis are about the size of a credit card. They typically have most of the following hardware:
* At least one USB 2.0
* 3.5 mm audio jack
* HDMI
* Micro USB or USB-C power supply
* SD Card reader
* LAN port
* Ribbon-camera module port
* GPIO pins for further extensions
 
As can be seen here, the ports allow the computer to fulfil the role of a home PC if required, and at the very least supports a multitude of peripherals for whichever project is undertaken. The operating system used is always Linux, however beginners are encouraged to start with Raspberry Pi OS, Raspberry Pi’s own distribution based on Debian OS. By attaching a keyboard, mouse, and an external display, the Pi can be used as a desktop computer including the ability to browse the internet.
 
## 1.1 What is the state of the art of this new technology?
Compared to similar DIY miniature computer boards such as Arduino and Makey Makey, the Raspberry Pi delivers the highest flexibility and computing power. The highest spec Raspberry Pi as of writing is the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. With up to 8GB of RAM, Gigabit Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth, 64-bit quad core CPU @ 1.80GHz, 40 pin GPIO, and newest generation of VideoCore GPU (Raspberry Pi 2022). These specifications are more than enough to compete with many modern PCs. While the gaming capabilities are not yet comparable, video streaming is exceptional and the scale of feasible projects has increased dramatically.

## 1.2 What can be done now?
The two micro HDMI ports support dual-monitor 4K video at 60fps. As a result, the Pi can be considered a competitive customisable home entertainment option made highly convenient due to the small form factor. Or with a bit of time and tinkering, one can rig up their own retro gaming console, an AI powered smart mirror, or automatic pet feeder. Being ultra modular and customisable, paired with the sheer power of the Pi, the possibilities are increasingly diverse. Even the much cheaper, lower end Pis are able to provide sufficient computing power for most projects. For example, the AUD$20 Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W can be used to make a WiFi security camera with live feed, or even a home server with network-wide ad blocking and a VPN (Cawley 2021).
 
## 1.3 What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?
With the progress that has been made in recent years, the near future of Raspberry Pi can be expected to bring massive hardware advancements. This may include more powerful and modern CPU/GPUs, 16GB RAM, and/or built-in storage. Looking the other way, it is not unreasonable to suggest a more powerful and functional budget option will make its way onto the market, perhaps a Raspberry Pi Zero 3 W. With the recent transition to technological subjects, a cheap product may incentivise schools to buy these Pis in bulk, thus exposing more children to the fascinating field of IT.
 
# 2.0 What is the likely impact?
## 2.1 What is the potential impact of this development?
The impact that Raspberry Pi has had, and is continuing to have, is getting people introduced to the inner workings of technology. Rather than merely using their phone throughout the day, they can gain an understanding and appreciation for the technologies employed. As our lives become more digital by the day, the demand for workers with cyber literacy also increases. Raspberry Pi has the potential to act as a stepping stone into this field; helping educate and introduce people to this side of technology for a very low cost.
 
## 2.2 What is likely to change?
Nothing is certain in regards to what will change. However, making computing more accessible and cost-efficient is likely to help individuals explore their interests and develop their skills.
 
## 2.3 Which people will be most affected and how?
The people that will be affected by these developments may range from no one to everyone. Since Raspberry Pis do not directly impact society in the way cybersecurity or autonomous vehicles do, it is up to the budding minds tinkering with the Pis to take their ideas and make something significant out of them.
 
## 2.4 Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?
The development of Raspberry Pis definitely has the potential to create jobs, but is most likely to fill jobs first. Until DIY computer chips become established educational tools and are recognised in the mainstream as contemporary computing options, jobs related to them such as specialised teachers will not see much demand. Meanwhile, the people building their IT skills through Raspberry Pis and the like draw nearer to obtaining existing jobs with real demand.
 
# 3.0 How will this affect you?
## 3.1 In your daily life, how will this affect you?
Personally, the development of Raspberry Pis is exciting as it allows me to explore my interest in computers in a way that I have ultimate control over. The low price of most models means it will rarely be a deciding factor when considering a project. The flexibility of the Pi allows me to take any small idea I have and quickly make it a tangible product. On top of this, the online community is extremely helpful, supportive and skillful, so any roadblocks can quickly be sorted out. Another big impact that Raspberry Pis have had for me is helping me learn about the inner workings of computers. It forced me to learn the basics of Linux systems, something that I expect to require in my future career. And it has given me a medium to exercise my programming skills in a way that feels more interactive than coding software alone.
 
## 3.2 What will be different for you?
The biggest difference between life with and without a Raspberry Pi is having an outlet to get hands on with hardware and software, and being able to ‘create’ rather than merely ‘use’. As Pis get more powerful and cheaper, I’ll be able to invest in more complex projects to digitise and customise my home without breaking the bank.
 
## 3.3 How might this affect members of your family or your friends?
Something I’ve always enjoyed doing is creating small projects for people in the hopes that it makes a task simpler for them. To date, it has mostly been Python scripts that automate something relevant to them, however the next level of this may be physical solutions via Raspberry Pi. My family and friends generally aren’t the type to create using the Pi, although I believe all of them could benefit in some way from a project built on one. It is in this way that Raspberry Pis have the ability to positively affect anyone, whether or not they are directly involved in the build process.
