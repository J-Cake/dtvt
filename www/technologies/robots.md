# Robots – IT Technologies

## What are robots?

Robots are types of automated machinery that can perform specific tasks with little or no human intercession (TechTarget n.d). Robots are deeply involved in almost every industry. Health care is one example of this. Its role in the health care industry includes performing spine surgery, rehabilitation, and therapy, all of which robots are largely reliant on. However, this is not for the purpose of replacing the duties of health care professionals but rather to assist in making their jobs easier and more efficient.  

## Robots In the Health Care Industry

Take the da Vinci Surgical System, for example. Using the hand movements of the operating surgeon's delicate manoeuvres, tiny equipment with the user's guidance, performs surgery on the patient's body. This initially allows for minimally invasive procedures in surgeries. 

Within some healthcare facilities around the world, service robots are considered to ‘relieve the daily burden on healthcare workers by handling routine logistical tasks’ (Intel n.d, para. 17). These robots' tasks generally involve tracking supplies and filing purchase orders, setting up the patient rooms, and restocking medical supplies.

These are only some examples of the importance of having robots within one of many industries. Just like how humans imagine the future to be overwhelmed with robots and AI technologies, cultivating robots as an IT Technology, will only pave the way for technological advancements.

## Evolution of Robots

Robots have been around as early as the 1950s, ‘the first digitally operated robot was invented by George Devol in 1954 and was ultimately called the Unimate’ (Adelaide Robotics Academy 2022, para. 9). The robot's name, Unimate, is a combination of the words “universal” and “automation,” and it moved using an electronically controlled hydraulic lifting arm. Some called it the 6 degrees of freedom, storing step-by-step digital commands. Unimate’s existence later laid down the foundation of modern robotics. Its first kind was then sold off to a company called General Motors in 1960, which was later implemented in Trenton, New Jersey ‘to lift hot pieces of metal from a die casting machine and stack them’ (Adelaide Robotics Academy 2022, para. 9). 

Since then, the technological advancements within the Robotic Industry have greatly improved from their stationary tasks. 12 years later, in 1966, the first mobile robot was invented by Nils John Nilsson, Bertram Raphael, and Charles Rosen; it was manufactured by SRI International. From a piece of stationary machinery that only operated with pre-set tasks, to being mobile and fitted with the world's first artificial intelligence capable of ‘planning, route-finding, and the rearranging of simple objects’ (SRI International n.d, para 1). 

## The Future

What can robots bring to the future? In summary, increased productivity, enchantment of daily life, and job loss. Every innovation has pros and cons. The only difference is the ratio. Enhancing life and removing millions of jobs seems contradictory. Although jobs are being lost, many more are being created, as well as within other industries. On the assumption that the future is dominated by robots; jobs that maintain, fix, replace, and improve these technologies would also exist. 

A strong candidate for adding life-changing technologies to the world would be Boston Dynamics. Boston Dynamics is an American engineering and robotics design company founded in 1992 (Wikipedia 2022, para. 1). Boston's latest innovation, which has caught the public’s eyes many times with every added feature, is the Atlas. A research platform that mimics full-body mobility. Such technology is always seen in movies and wondered if such a thing could exist. Within a couple of years, technology like Atlas could possibly be employed in labour jobs. Jobs that require constant movement, lifting, rearranging, etc. 

As of now, according to the information Boston Dynamics has provided, Atlas can currently lift a load of 25 pounds (11.3kgs). Given a few years of improvements, its lift capacity would most likely increase, therefore being able to constantly do work more efficiently and reliably 24/7. Technological advancements that make this possible include Transfer learning for AI, this technique efficiently reuses knowledge gained from previous tasks, this is then reapplied to tasks that are the same or similar.

For more humanoid robots, like Tesla’s robot, although not being physically constructed, the amount of research and technologies said to be implemented in this innovation is very feasible.

As shown in the image above, the technologies that make up this robot are:

- Autopilot cameras
- FSD computers
- Multi-cam video neural networks
- Neural net planning, auto-labelling
- Simulation & tools
- FSD hardware
- Dojo training

## Impacts

What are the likely impacts of this development? Firstly, we’ll have to look at the current trends we have seen throughout the implementation of Robots in recent years. At the height of the pandemic, Australia suffered a great loss of jobs. With many jobs being done at home, there were also plenty that could only be done at work. Many companies struggled through this sudden change of events, with some, unfortunately, being forced to close. In July 2020, Australia recorded the biggest jump in unemployment it’s seen in recent years, increasing to 7.4% of overall unemployment in Australia, shown in the graph below. (Australian Bureau of Statistics).

The ‘Robots’ infiltration of the workforce doesn't occur at a steady, gradual pace. Instead, automation happens in bursts’ (Mark Muro, Robert Maxim, Jacob Whiton 2020, para. 3). With the sudden absence of many people in the workplace, where would you turn to when people become unreliable? Where would you look when a pandemic seems to be impossible to contain? What would you do, knowing the long-term impacts of constant shortages of labour workers. Invest in robots and automation. With the installation of robots, productivity and profits increase. This is the result of Robots not getting tired, taking breaks, taking time to learn tasks, but can work around the clock without pay. This generally creates a more efficient manufacturing cycle that produces products at a constant, predictable, and faster rate. With the unlikelihood of making mistakes, robots are more reliable. Who will be the most affected and how? Plain and simple, manufacturing occupations or labour driven jobs. People working in the manufacturing industry are probably the most concerned, this is due to being in the most extensive area where robots and AI have the highest probability of being implemented. Although many jobs are being replaced, others are being created in its place. 

## Types of Robots

The technology behind robots is only getting better. With each new function a robot obtains, the better they’re going to be at their jobs. Depending on how this would affect a person, we’ll have to review the types of robots there are. 

These different types of robots are:

- Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR). These types of robots are the type that roams around the world making their own decision in near real-time.  These robots utilise cameras and sensors to navigate around their surroundings. With onboard processing equipment, analysing and making decisions on whether to avoid entities or pick the correct parcels. These types of robots only need little human intervention (intel n.d)

- Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV). Unlike the AMR, AGV relies on predetermined paths that often require operator oversight. This robot is regularly used for delivery of items/ material that are required within another area of a warehouse.

- Articulated Robots. Also known as robotic arms, they are meant to mimic the movements of real arms. The robot arms include up to 10 rotary joints, which allow for flexibility, just like real arms.

- Humanoids. Just like how they sound, they’re robots with the shape same or like a human. These robots are highly advanced in terms of processing, such as the Tesla robot that was mentioned in the third paragraph. Just like articulated Robots, Humanoids use joints, which for obvious reasons are for movements. Without these joints, they’d just be robot statues with human features. They use many of the same or similar technology components as ‘AMRs to sense, plan, and act as they carry out task such as providing directions or offering concierge services’ (Intel n.d para, 7)  

## Influencing our Lives

The most life-changing robot out of the four would have to be the humanoid robot. Why do you ask? It’s simply because of how similar they are to us, and how diverse tasks they’re capable of performing. It isn’t just limited to labour assignments, but also emotional comfort. Taking advantage of its NLP (Natural Learning Processing) system, asking questions or having conversations with the humanoid robot isn’t out of the question. Although there are limitations on the degree of human-like responses, developing a more advanced system capable of distinguishing between tones of speech, like the pitch of voice and the words used, a more accurate reply is achievable in accordance with the situation. They are everywhere, and soon enough, they’ll be by your side.
