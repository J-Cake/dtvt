| Stephanie | Okay, Hi Alex, thanks for agreeing to join for our interview for our university assessment. So, I'm Stephanie, I'm studying part-time at university, and Jacob can introduce himself. |
| Jacob     | Yep. I'm Jacob. I'm also studying at RMIT - we're in the same group, we're doing Introduction to IT. Thanks for joining us. |
| Alex      | No worries at all, happy to be here                          |
| Stephanie | Thanks Alex. So please, tell us about your IT work, what exactly do you do? |
| Alex      | Okay, so, I'm a solutions architect for Suncorp in the security strategy and architecture team. I mainly work on our 'Security Program of Work' initiatives, and to lead projects which we go to through our discovery processes and phases into delivery, so we implement new technology that help to deliver new capability enhancements and uplift our overall protections and security at Suncorp. |
| Stephanie | So please, on that, is it mainly the Security Program of Work that you work on? |
| Alex      | Yea, so my current projects that I'm working on are endpoint security, so actually removing our legacy products like Semanta, Carbon Black, and we're introducing new products that are more in line with the industry capability and sophistication, so we're introducing products such as Crouchstrike, and Airlock. So Crouchstrike's your antivirus agents that you might run on your devices at home, and Airlock is an application whitelisting technology, so that people who may try and install things in their own user profiles - Google Chrome is a typical one, which people can still install, even if they don't have administrative rights on their workstations, so Airlock is an application whitelisting product, which will knock that stuff out. So that way, if we roll out newer software to the organisation, it's stamped, signed, and people can only run whatever we actually package and deploy. So that's endpoint security. I'm also working on Azure Information Protection which, Stephanie might've come across, potentially, maybe in your travels so far, but I know we have rolled out across in excess of about 6-7000 users across our organisation already - that's across Australia & New Zealand and information protection is essentially bringing to life, our data classification and quality assurance standard, so basically there's 5 classifications, so there's Group Use Only, Public, Highly Protected, Customer / HR Data, and Highly Sensitive, and I can't think of the other one. So essentially in your Microsoft Products, you'll get a little button to classify the content that you're creating. EEC controls, which is just about securing our partners - what they have access to in our organisation, so during Covid, we had to relax some of our controls, our security posture in order to allow partners overseas to be able to gain access to Suncorp over the remote connections easily. So we're looking to restrengthen that posture there. And the last one amongst rats and mice I guess is our Citrix Post Authentication so that's essentially - so Stephanie, when you're at home and you log on to Citrix or Modern Desktop, there's a little check that we do on the background to see if you've got an antivirus client, a firewall enabled and some other elements, just to ensure that you're coming from a device that we semi-trust. So they're the 4 things on my plate at the moment. |
| Stephanie | So what's your role on the project - So what does the solutions architect actually do? |
| Alex      | I lead projects from a technical point-of-view. I work with the vendors to ensure that they understand Suncorp's guiding principles, our architecture strategy, the products that they need to integrate with, so essentially I'm leading it from an architecture point-of-view. And I'm also assisting project managers, the IT engineers as well to understand what they need to implement, so I'll typically put together a design so they can then follow and produce a detailed design on the back of - so what I put together is more high-level, but it will hit the exact points that they need and give them the clarity they need in order to go off and do their bits of work. |
| Stephanie | So that's Architecture Context or is that a step after that? |
| Alex      | It's a step after that. We do do some architecture context stuff depending on the type of project it is, but generally, we understand what we need to do so we just dive straight into the design and then we hand that off for delivery so we'll also lead and put together the artifacts, requirements gathering, so we do the role of the BA as well and BA's are very hard to come by so - in fact we've got one that's leaving so if you know a good BA, let me know. |
| Stephanie | So you know how you said you put together a high-level design, what application do you use to pull that together, Visio? |
| Alex      | Yeah. So Visio's used to put together what you'd see when you're designing a building, so it's really a visual to help articulate how we're going to stitch together things and also what it looks like, so the design, if we high-level it, it would be showing, like if it was a SAAS service, so Software as a Service, so you might just show a cloud for example then you might show Suncorp's datacentres, with some servers inside it and you'll show the endpoint out there and the types of endpoints they would be, and showing that there's a single-sign on service out there, so really just giving a graphical representation of how that system hangs together end-to-end. So that's where Visio comes in and then to actually put the design together, that's really just done in Microsoft Word, where I've created a template - so I've only been in cybersecurity for about a couple years, so we've got a high-level design template that I've created back there and I've brought that back over to security, so fleshing that out with all the relevant information that's needed - the design, the implementation, how to operationalise it - it's the procurement side of things, so what software licensing's attached and how things should be configured like logging, monitoring, so covering all those facets, then guide the team that need to look at their own independent sections to go off and do their designs and implementation. That can be 20 docs up to 120 docs and really depends on what you're looking at, whether it's simple or complex. |
| Stephanie | That's very interesting - always wondered what is architectural in a project |
| Alex      | We're on the hook to be responsible and usually, we've got EMs and EGMs breathing down our necks to make sure that things are going right, |
| Jacob     | Just gonna ask, you're less involved in actually writing software and more involved in the deployment and laying out what the final project is actually going to look like, as opposed to working on individual pieces of it. So is my understanding correct? |
| Alex      | Correct. So we don't typically, in an organisation like Suncorp, we don't custom write, or develop software, that's far more intensive and costly, we will buy things off the shelf or procure software as a service, or platform as a service, like cloud, obviously, cloud is very big, and Suncorp's strategy is to enter more into cloud, and so we'll chew on those services a lot more, so really, as an architect, I need to ensure all the people I need to deliver - delivery of that software or service into the organisation and give the right guidance to the engineers so they know what they're doing. So there's a lot of workshops we'll pull together with the relevant stakeholders to make sure that they're doing and where their involvement needs to be. |
| Stephanie | On that, say if you're working on a piece as well, do you need to engage with other architects from other domains, or are you generally across the lot, or do you engage like an enterprise architect? |
| Alex      | So we all work quite closely together, and it really depends on again, the type of project or what we're trying to achieve, so you know, some projects can live solely within my domain, so cybersecurity and risks, and then there's most likely, because of the infrastructure that's involved, there's *T&T* infrastructure that is where we go, and we'll flick that over to infrastructure to actually do the delivery. Where we then have to broaden out, really depends on the system, so definitely, we engage with other domain architects across the business - insurance, banking, digital, and even across to New Zealand as well, depending on the day, and the nature of it. A good example of that is probably Office 365, so that was one of my projects as I was in infrastructure, that was touching all parts of the business, and I had to go many domain architects and enterprise architect councils to ensure we're selling the right tools and the - not sure if you're familiar, an A to A which is an approval to act process. So ensuring that we get all of our lines of business to agree to having their data stored in the cloud, so it's that cloud governance aspect - at the time that was heavy lifting that we got a blanket approach across the organisation. |
| Stephanie | Please tell us about the industry you work in?               |
| Alex      | Commonly known as the FSI, Financial Services Industry, and specifically, Suncorp is banking and insurance, yea, I'm not too sure how much more I can say about the industry I work in, I've been in the industry for many years, so I came from Insurance Australia Group, I did about 12 years there, then I was at Bank of Queensland so, 2 or 3 years, and I got tapped on the shoulder to come across to Suncorp. We all know what Banking Insurance is, I hope. |
| Stephanie | So I think we've covered Question 3, so number 4; Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? So you did touch on this that you have to work with engineers, developers, architects, is there anyone else? |
| Alex      | So I work across a lot of different fields, so your IT specialists across technology and transformations, the whole IT area, really project dependent, again, I will get a lot of questions from various parts of the organisation as well, cause they seem to be doing like Title Searches or something but I'll get random care things, so I'm dealing with lots of different people from different capacities. No it's great cause I love it. I also interact with our PMO, our Project Managers and Program Managers, and coordinators and you name, it, obviously becoming into management, I do a lot of work with, cause when we're starting to kick of RFIs, RFQs, RFPs if my sign says something in that area then I'll deal heavily with those guys. |
| Stephanie | So what's RFIs?                                              |
| Alex      | Request for Information.                                     |
| Stephanie | And then RFQs is Request for?                                |
| Alex      | Request for Query, and the procurement. But yes, I work heavily with those guys when in the buildup into procuring software, etc. And also around statements of work that we might need services from our vendors. I work with out Data Governors team, and the information protection project I'm doing, so it's about making sure that their standards that we're bringing to life properly through that technology tool. With that digital banking, insurance technology, enterprise architects, IT services desk internal comms, corporate affairs, and layers across EGMs and executive managers, so typically, as an architect, you actually don't do too much architecture, which I find, you get thrown *Hey I need you to do this*, and so you just go off and do it, and it may not even be related to your role, so I'm putting together presentations for EGMs or SOAPs, so Jacob, that's a Solution on a doc, which is trying to get a decision around an issue, and presenting facts and recommendations. |
| Jacob     | Like an elevator pitch, but more formal?                     |
| Stephanie | It's meant to be on a doc, but I've seen ones that are 6 docs long |
| Alex      | Ah my god, yep, as soon as I see those, I just go *start it again*, it's one doc. That's a lot of different people, but I've been out to our stores as well, doing stores visits, at Suncorp, so I interact with people on the ground to understand what kind of issues they're having, and try to bring some of those themes back so we can put up initiatives so we can make a difference for our frontline staff as an example. So it's quite diverse. |
| Stephanie | So I think we've covered question 5, which was *tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals* - that's everyone that you work with, |
| Alex      | Well I did answer this one with some notes of mine, *well, due* to the nature of my role. I guess a lot of what I do as an architect is really providing guidance, it's around best practices, advice, it's giving feedback to the engineers that bring their designs or what they may be struggling with, to the table, and so you're literally responding to a lot of questions along the way and you're doing a lot of documentation review and approval. So another part of my role is to ensure that the designs that people put together are approved and endorsed so that - we have an audit for our trial of what got done and delivered, and it matches back to the design - another one I work a lot with, internal audit - they like to put us through the ringer, having all the documentation all reviewed and approved is one of those big points to flick at them and just *read that* and we're done. |
| Stephanie | So you don't really work with clients or investors, in your role, hey? |
| Alex      | Not investors, but I guess my clients are internal, so and really they're made up of those different people that I interact with daily, so my clients are internal |
| Stephanie | So what aspects of your work do you spend most time on?      |
| Alex      | Probably projects, really, so I said before, as an architect, you're centric around the projects, working around the security, protocls, so they're our primary focus and that's where we from recoveries point of view, how you earn your wage, at Suncorp, is to make sure you're fully recovered, from an internal budget point of view, so I need to make sure in my PPM, I'm smashing that with some good hours, so that's where I spend most of my time, on projects, on delivery. that's probably most of the time. |
| Stephanie | What aspects of your work do you find the most challenging?  |
| Alex      | most challenging would be project timelines - and I'm not talking, is it too aggressive, it's more projects here at Suncorp seem to tend to go on for a lot longer than what they should, so it's project exhaustion that can occur, and then often if there is a project that wants something done very quickly, so you might have an EGM - not naming names in infrastructure - that says *hey I want this done now, or by this day* then generally because of the push for that then there can be rework so it gets in but then now we need to go back because it was done so quickly, that we need to spend more money to really work that or recheck it, so I guess just the red tape, but that comes with the big organisation, like Suncorp or any others - the red tape I'm referring to is how you get from A to Z, so there's a lot of red tape in the governance and processes. So that's the challenging bits where I have to try and make sure I do those fast and efficient, so that we're not delaying projects so often. People think *We can just start*, but actually no, we've got all this process stuff we need to do first, so you're trying to be around the background to get that done, while you're still trying to kick off the project. That's the challenging bit |
| Stephanie | And PMOs                                                     |
| Alex      | Ah PMOs, but no, I've got a really good relationship with PMOs actually, so I'm not sure if you're familiar with Chrissy _____ or ______ _______ in infrastructure, they're incredible. |
| Stephanie | Last question; can you share an example of the work that you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry? |
| Alex      | The movement to cloud, so what we're really seeing that I think captures not just the essence of the industry, but what is currently on trend at the moment for a lot of organisations is being involved in some of that work which will eventually seed the elimination of our own datacentres that we own and run, and manage, so being involved in that movement from datacentres to cloud is something that I think the IT industry is seeing a big movement on, so that would be the essence. Being involved in that work. So I think I can share - because it's public, Suncorp is looking to exit its datacentres over the next couple of years potentially, I won't give an dates, but that's essentially so we can move into someone else's datacentres - you know they call it a cloud but really it's someone else's datacentre. Let's just put a funny little white cloud around it and call it that. but I think that movement is where everyone's going. So I think there's a very big change in the way that organisations need to manage their budgets and how they'll be spending their money, so a lot more Op ecs than Cap Ecs so really finance teams really need to turn the table on how they actually run their finance bowls for ____. Sorry, longwinded but, the example there is cloud |
| Stephanie | No, it's exactly what we're learning about right now. I think that was all of our questions, did you have any other questions Jacob, |
| Jacob     | No actually I think you've answered most of our stuff, apart from obviously what we asked before about you working closely with the software developers, but we closed that topic. Other than that I think that's everything |
| Alex      | With the software developers, they're - I call them a breed of their own, but generally, in my early career, if you were a developer, people pictured you as sitting in a corner tapping away with a can of coke and a packet of salt and vinegar chips - almost like a mushroom growing in the corner, so with our software developer guys, generally we have our digital business because they're creating the new - they invest in time into creating the externally public facing apps for iOs and Android and the like, so really a software development occurs across our brands in order to service our customers externally. So those guys, we don't really get involved, but we do have what's called Software development lifecycle so it's an SDL which has a bunch of things that developers need to adhere to when they're designing or coding their applications, so some definite guard rails that say *You must do A, B, C, D*, ensure that things are secure by design, it doesn't leak customer data, and doesn't break any of our guarding principles around how you develop an application. Generally those guys are really good aligning to that SDL, so really it's just a tick in the box type stuff when we get to review those SDLs when they complete them - we know they're doing the right thing, and if they don't then they know we've got monitoring and tools across their applications that they're implementing or developing which will actually identify if they've done something naughty, so we've got eyes on our software developers from an automation point of view, so we know when things are going wrong. But good question, |
| Jacob     | I'm curious about where all these go, because I'm looking to get into software development myself, and so one of the big questions I often have is what actually is the job. Because I'm ideally looking for a job where I am sitting on my rear-end all day and actually writing code, yea growing out of the corner, |
| Alex      | Yea I'm sure it's a lot different now - is it Mars bars or something else, I don't know. |
| Jacob     | But the fundamentals haven't changed, and that's the important bit, |
| Alex      | I think if you're looking to code, they are definitely skills that you'll need in the future. so I think as someone who can understand coding languages across different platforms - ios, android, windows, I think they're very handy coding skills to have because you'll pick up work anywhere, because the world is going digital, if not already, and like I said, everything's moving from on-premise to cloud, so a lot of that coding is then used to make things automated and make things a lot smarter - robotics is behind it - all the cool stuff. So it's definitely a cool area. |
| Jacob     | I'm finding that as well                                     |
| Alex      | Just gotta have the right attitude, if you're like me or Stephanie, we just don't do coding - oh we struggle with it |
| Jacob     | That's why you get someone else to do it, hey?               |
| Alex      | That's right – outsource.                                    |
| Stephanie | Do you have any closing comments, Alex to add to the interview? |
| Alex      | Well, thank you for choosing me - or second choice because someone went to hospital, but I won't hold that against you so if you could come up to me first next time, but it was really great to be involved, I'm more than happy to participate. it was nice to meet you Jacob, I'm the country man myself, I'm sure you'll do well as you choose and always good to see your smiling face Stephanie. |
| Stephanie | Thanks so much we'll talk soon                               |
| Alex      | Alright, have a good night, we'll talk soon.                 |
