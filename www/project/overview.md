# The vegan detector

## Overview

A mobile app that enables the user to scan and classify ingredients, and then the app can therefore confirm whether it is vegan. The application will use various technologies such as text scanning technology through the phone’s camera, and it will utilise existing technology such as barcode scanners. 

## Motivation

Currently there’s apps for vegans where users can search a product, or scan a barcode, however there’s currently no app that can identify ingredients, particularly certain chemicals and food colourings to confirm if it is vegan. 

Veganism is growing in popularity, and most vegans can confirm at a quick glance of an ingredients list if a product is plant based. However, for new vegans, and in particular for certain chemicals and food colourings, even for experienced vegans it is hard to identity. Australia's vegan food market is projected to be the third-fastest-growing vegan market in the world with a growth rate of 9.6 percent, according to Statista.
