# The vegan detector

## Outcome

This application would be another tool to assist and promote the benefits of veganism. With studies showing that the average lifespan of a vegan can be up to 9 years(1) longer than their non vegan counterpart, there’s a growing interest in society to take up this new lifestyle.  

Yes, veganism is a lifestyle, that goes beyond abstaining from using animal products. Research shows that vegans are less likely to smoke or drink alcohol, they exercise regularly and avoid overly processed junk foods which all contribute to lower health risks (2). 

For most, the thought of such drastic changes in lifestyle can be daunting as there are so many steps to take. Though the first step could be the hardest, it’s also the easiest. We all need to eat, so what better way to start our lifestyle shift than to focus on eating right, eating vegan. 

From newly fledged to long time vegans, or even just inquisitive minds looking to change their dietary intake or have vegan alternatives, this application takes the hassle out of shopping for these products. Through your smartphone’s camera, the application can scan the ingredients list and instantly tell you if the product is vegan and also output links to further information for those ingredients that may be questionable. 

The potential of this application goes far beyond the current scope of an ingredients reader.  

Through the implementation of various databases, this app can expand its scope and coverage. 

A database of vegan alternative ingredients and recipes could be implemented to increase vegan awareness and allow users to discover and multitude of possible delicacies of vegan cooking. Being a vegan isn’t just about eating unflavoured vegetables. 

A public access database, much like Wikipedia, where registered users can contribute information on certain ‘questionable’ ingredients and manufacturers can respond accordingly can promote community involvement and support vegan product manufacturers. 

The idea of knowing that manufacturer X uses vegan products would build customer loyalty from the growing vegan community while offering marketing opportunities for these manufacturer X. 

With the integration of NLP and machine learning, the app would be able to process and learn user preferences and make relevant suggestions for daily intake. Further development could allow this app to integrate with the current market smart assistants and be a necessary part of every vegans daily planner.
