# Testing

Due to the limitations of technology and time, our testing was done in a closed environment with a small sample database. Ideally, when a recognised barcode is scanned, the results should output an ingredients list with the corresponding colours to indicate whether the ingredient is vegan friendly, not vegan friendly, questionable. Our main focus on testing would be to understand how well our technology combines the database scanning.
