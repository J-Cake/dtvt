# Risks

## Security

To ensure the safety of the company data integrity and security, there will be a requirement of writing secure codes, encrypting all data, being cautious with libraries, allowing authorised API's only, high-level authentication, use the principle of least privilege, deploy proper session handling, use cryptography tools and techniques & lastly, test repeatedly (penetration testing). 

## Data Reliability

The biggest risk to the app’s is the authenticity of data from various product manufacturers in the case of a questionable ingredient. For example, in the case of ingredient ‘Palm Oil’ which can come from both vegan friendly and non vegan friendly sources (sustainably sourced or not), the app output will be determined by the developers. This data will be collected from the product manufacturer using the said ingredient. 

This would also be an issue with the map search feature as Google Maps doesn’t ensure flagged restaurants are update with their menus. The data could be outdated and the developers won’t know of changes until users raise flags. 

# Group Processes and Communication

Team Do the Thing has been strong with member communication and interaction. Our members initiated contact within the first week of this unit and we’ve continued to maintain regular contact via our group’s Discord channel. 

Going into Assignment 2, we encountered various hurdles which we easily overcame by working together through open communication. Our weekly meets schedule has been maintained from A2, with Monday’s meet being our ‘task allocation for the week’ Meet, and Thursday’s meet being our ‘check in’ Meet. 

Members have kept in contact on a daily basis through social interactions via Discord and much of the banter and discussions continue to happen there. It’s from this regular interaction that we’ve become comfortable to speak up about concerns and ask for help from each other.
