# Roles

Roles weren’t necessary for our group as we opted to continue with our task division style from our previous assignment. As a group, we read through the requirements brief, then brainstormed ideas and segmented the tasks into manageable sections that were headed by each member based on their preferences and strengths. In the case where more than one member volunteered for tasks, they’d decide it between themselves. To date, there have been no issues with this style of task division for our group. 

To ensure that member concerns and queries would be addressed in a timely manner for our weekly task targets, we endeavoured to maintain mid week meetings to ‘check in’ and discuss how individual targets are going.

# Scopes and Limits

## Scope

The primal objective was to design an application for Veganism needs. Covering a broad list of dietary management, local vegan-friendly restaurants, list of recipes & a barcode scanning feature.

We had constructed a 16-week timeline of our project allocating tasks to be completed by each week. Compiled on a high-level, we had set out a deep and thoughtful process to ensure the viability of our individual commitments & constraints.

Blueprints of how the application functionality and user engagements have been presented within the Wireframes & Sitemap. This provides a further insight of what the application will look like, how it will operate and how certain functions within the application will be applied to the real world. The 'Ingredient Scanner' is the scanning functionality that captures QR Codes or barcodes to then analyse the ingredients to flag if this product is vegan safe.

## Limits

We have come across hurdles in our path that we simply cannot implement into our environment in a small amount of time, due to costly requirements or extensive time required to develop the mechanism.

The scanning concept is a very broad and open tool that we have attempted to implement on the most basic level possible, our end-goal would be to incorporate text scanner & label scanners (example: Vino) to the application but due to the costly requirements these have not been crucial to the beginning of our application timeline. 

Our Restaurant search feature is a component that requires a lot of time. When the application hits the market, our consumers will be across the globe therefore, a deep analysis of what vegan friendly restaurant nearby will be an extensive project itself to ensure the application is providing the correct information and is not misleading
