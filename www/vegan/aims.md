# Aims

The aim of the project is to concept an app for mobile devices that can be used by vegans, or potential vegans on a daily basis to maintain a healthy diet.

## General Layout and Features
The initial steps of the app is to dream big but be realistic. How far can we go with this app with today’s technology, and is it relevant to society’s demands? There’s no point putting wings on a pig if no one will buy it... So the following will be the features we would like to achieve if given enough time and resources.

## Scanning feature
The apps primary feature which makes it stand out from other vegan apps will be the scanner. The idea is to incorporate scanning technology to scan a product label, barcode, QR code or product ingredients list and output data in a straightforward traffic light system to indicate if the product is vegan friendly (green), not vegan friendly (red), or questionable (orange). 

## Restaurant Search feature
This feature allows users to search for nearby vegan friendly restaurants. Through the use of map integration via technology such as Google Maps API. This will have to be paired with a database for vegan friendly restaurants to contribute to.

## Recipes and Vegan alternatives
Every vegan will want to try their hand at make their own meals, so having access to a database of vegan alternative recipes is a must! 

## Nutrition and Calories Planner
Another essential that goes in line with personal health that many users (not just vegans) are looking for these days. This allows the user to set or monitor their intake. Usually found in health and diet focused apps, this is one of the many additions that would allow ‘Do The Vegan Thing’ App to stand out from the competitors.
