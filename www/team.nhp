## [Phi Bui](https://fi-boo.github.io/Intro_to_IT_ASS-1/)
Phi Bui (S2008156) was born in Vietnam and immigrated to Australia at the age of 2 where his family settled in Richmond, Victoria. 

Graduating from St. Kevin’s college Toorak in 1999, he would go on to study a Bachelor of Engineering for a year before dropping out and entering the work force. Through his various interactions with IT technologies and personnel in the workplace, his growing interest in IT would lead him to eventually return to tertiary studies. Currently he is enrolled in a Bachelor of IT at RMIT through Open University. 

When not PC gaming or ‘googling’, he enjoys spending time fishing and camping with his children.]

Clayton Phillips (s3952384) was born in Dubbo, NSW and went through high school in Bega, NSW where he graduated in 2021. He enjoys spending his spare time playing sports and various competitive online games. Coming from a technology savvy family, he quickly gained interest in all computer-related things.

## [Nuulaiti Junior Lale](https://mynamejunior.github.io/Assessment1/index.html)
Nuulaiti (S3940026) recently graduated from High School in 2022, working throughout 2021. His parents moved to Australia back in 1998 from Samoa after his eldest brother's 2nd birthday. Nuulaiti used to do sports like rugby and Muay Thai as a form of staying in shape. He’s currently undertaking this study online for its convenience in time flexibility. Nuulaiti’s interest in IT first sparked after he bought a pc, messing around with different parts, trying to troubleshoot issues that appeared here and there. In general, he was always interested in how things worked. Nuulaiti has little to no IT experience, other than the foundation he is currently building while undertaking this course. This includes HTML and CSS, all of which are being used within VScode. ]

* Turbulent adventurers (ISFP-T) are known to possess the team oriented trait of sensitivity to others; relate to them, establish harmony and minimise conflict. Other traits include artistic, curious and imaginative. ISFP-Ts can show their creativity through tangible means, when interested in a topic they'll explore thoroughly on their own, and like to come up with bold ideas that appeal to others. 
* Visual learners are best able to learn through words, illustrations, diagrams, videos and the like. In a team setting, it's useful to have someone that easily comprehends charts, graphs, diagrams, etc, and can pick up on small visual details the others might have missed. 
* Kinaesthetic learners best engage with information hands on. In a team environment, this may be recognised due to a need for rigorous experimentation on some code, for example.]

* As a protagonist (ENFJ-T) helping others where help within reasonable capability can be provided is without a thought, this could be contributing a little on the website, doing some extra research, or even providing some ideas.  
* This also ties in with creativity. This aspect allows the group to filter and solve problems more blatantly and with innovation. Moreover, searching for effective and efficient solutions for each problem. 
* Being a visual learner, associating ideas, words and concepts with images assists in better understanding and retaining information. Having multiple different learning styles allows the team to perceive and think in a different perspective.]
