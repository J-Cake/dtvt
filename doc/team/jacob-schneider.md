* Kinaesthetic learners are those who have a strong intuition for physical systems, and can often provide alternative perspectives on certain concepts by exploring and tinkering. 
* Less creative often comes strongly detail-oriented, obsessive behaviours which would aid a team in producing a very polished and final project.
