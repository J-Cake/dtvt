### Impact

* Turbulent adventurers (ISFP-T) are known to possess the team oriented trait of sensitivity to others; relate to them, establish harmony and minimise conflict. Other traits include artistic, curious and imaginative. ISFP-Ts can show their creativity through tangible means, when interested in a topic they'll explore thoroughly on their own, and like to come up with bold ideas that appeal to others. 
* Visual learners are best able to learn through words, illustrations, diagrams, videos and the like. In a team setting, it's useful to have someone that easily comprehends charts, graphs, diagrams, etc, and can pick up on small visual details the others might have missed. 
* Kinaesthetic learners best engage with information hands on. In a team environment, this may be recognised due to a need for rigorous experimentation on some code, for example.
