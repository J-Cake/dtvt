Groupwork has never been a strongpoint of mine, however the group operated incredibly well to the point where deadlines and assignment requirements were met and work was completed in a timely manner to an exceptional standard. I've come to realise the importance of task-allocation in groups to give a solid structure to all work that needs doing. Perhaps the only improvement I'd make is the clarity with which tasks are allocated. I found myself having to clarify several times before beginning a section of work and what exactly is expected of me, as well as the segment has been assigned to me. Naturally this is not a flaw of the group, rather one within myself, specifically relating to my organisational skills (or lack thereof), which otherwise thanks to the carefully considered layout of the Teams channels and format of the documents we were using made work very productive and efficient. A+ to the team! You guys are great!
