## What went well? 

I think our group handled time management really well. We got together quite early in the unit and decided to stay ahead of the tasks by jumping on them early. As soon as this assignment was released, we had already started formulating strategies to handle each task on a weekly basis. 

## What could be improved? 

Personally, I feel that I could have spent more time on the research and write up of my IT component. Due to time constraints and other commitments I chose to keep a lot of the information brief. 

## What was surprising? 

I was very surprised at how well the group worked together. Thereâ€™s such a large spread of age and experience, but we meshed very well. Everyone was supportive of one another and eager to take up tasks without being told to do so. It was awesome to see that we could have a laugh with each other yet also focus and get tasks done when needed. 

## What have you learned about groups? 

Working as a group is hard. Even though there are more hands on deck to work on tasks, there are also more complications that may arise. The biggest one I noticed was scheduling group meets. Surprisingly this took the longest for us to agree upon due to various clashes in each members personal schedule. I can only imagine how much longer it'd take with even larger groups.
