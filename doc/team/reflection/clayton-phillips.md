## What went well? 

The biggest positive about this whole process was that everyone brought their own set of skills which directly contributed to the work that needed to be done. Since we recognised this from early on, we were able to quickly allocate tasks that coincided with our abilities and get started. This resulted in the most efficient system and gave us a useful head start. 

## What could be improved? 

Personally, I feel like there were times when I underestimated the amount of time I'd need to spend on a task. This would then lead to a degree of stress that could've easily been avoided. In future, I need to allocate ample time for every task I'm set to do.

## What was surprising? 

As mentioned before, our group has talent in various areas which greatly contributed to the overall assignment quality. Coming into this, I expected most people to be clueless about the tools and technologies we would use, however someone always stepped up. 

## What have you learned about groups? 

I've learned that being confident in a group allows me to rest easy knowing that the work they've been allocated will get done in due time.
