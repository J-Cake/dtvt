* As a protagonist (ENFJ-T) helping others where help within reasonable capability can be provided is without a thought, this could be contributing a little on the website, doing some extra research, or even providing some ideas.  
* This also ties in with creativity. This aspect allows the group to filter and solve problems more blatantly and with innovation. Moreover, searching for effective and efficient solutions for each problem.
