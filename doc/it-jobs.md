# IT Jobs

### What common elements are there, if any?

We have two aspiring Developers, an Engineer, a Program Manager, Technical Support Specialist and a Technical Lead. Four of the roles being the Developers, Engineers and Technical Support Specialist similar required skills sets, particularly in fluency in many coding languages. Many of the roles also require experience in multiple Operating Systems, with some systems requiring specific computers like Linux, Windows, and Mac.  

The Developers Need experience in Cloud operated based systems, such as GitHub Version control and DevOps.  

Steph, Taleb & Junior's roles are closest linked in regards to team leadership, liaise with multiple stakeholders and project coordination.  

Whereas Clayton, Jacob, and Phi's ideal jobs are more involved in executing the technology work.

### What differentiates each position from the others, if anything?

The 2 leadership roles (Program Manager and Technical Lead) are unique in that there is less involvement in the executing of technology work, rather oversight and direction for the project teams. There is 1 Technical Support role, which is different from the other positions as this role would have the most 'customer-facing' interactions. They would generally provide level 3 support for escalations, whether that be internal or external customers. If the Technical Support Specialist is positioned within a project team, then they would be completing User Accepting Testing (UAT's) and be consulted as a Subject Matter Expert (SME) for User Experience Design.  

The Full stack Developer's role is unique form the Software Developer, as they would be across the full scope of software  (full stack is end to end user experience). Whereas the Software Developer's role is tied to specific problems, executing calculations within the programming in the back end, with much less focus on user experience.  

The Engineer is unique from the Developer roles, as they would be responsible for deploying and handling the infrastructure, with much less involvement in writing the code.  

### How similar or different are your career plans across the group?

Our Career Plans are quite similar, in that we all aim ton complete our degrees and to gain experience relevant to our Ideal Jobs. Stephanie's Career plan is the most different in the group as she is completing her Business Degree where the rest of the Project team are completing a Bachelor of Information Technology. As an exercise to understand how our roles would fit into a project team, we created the below visual on how our ideal jobs would interact in a project setting.
